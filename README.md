#### Comparing ML Algorithms to Determine Which is Most Effective at Determining the Presence of Brain Tumors


In this project, I strived to determine which machine learning models are the most efficient and accurate in determining the presence of brain tumors. Specifically, the goal was to process a dataset to determine if brain tumors can be detected with more than 75% accuracy using machine learning. Hyperparameter optimization was used to achieve high accuracy. 

The chosen dataset includes just over 250 axial MRI brain scans, thus providing a sufficient dataset to properly analyze. Medical professionals can utilize ML models to improve their diagnostics and healthcare delivery. These models can supplement a radiologistâ€™s judgment and help neurologists provide more accurate results. K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Muti-Layer Perceptron Models were compared, with a KNN model with 9 neighbors being the most effective.
